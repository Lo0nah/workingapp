Setting and accomplishing your financial goals through careful resource management is the process of financial planning. It entails evaluating your existing financial condition, figuring out your short- and long-term goals, and developing a plan to get there. Budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management are frequently included in this. Income, expenses, risk tolerance, and the time frame for reaching particular milestones are all taken into account in a well-structured financial plan. To keep your strategy in line with your changing circumstances and ambitions, regular assessments and modifications are necessary.
